Understanding the Concepts:

Asset: Anything of value to an organization (digital or physical, e.g., data, servers, computers).
Threat: An event or circumstance that can negatively impact assets (e.g., insider threats, advanced persistent threats (APTs)).
Risk: The likelihood of a threat impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset (e.g., external/internal risks, legacy systems, software compliance).
Vulnerability: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., ProxyLogon, ZeroLogon, Log4Shell).
Risk Management Strategies:

Acceptance: Accepting a risk if disruption to business continuity is too high.
Avoidance: Taking steps to entirely eliminate the risk.
Transference: Transferring the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
Mitigation: Reducing the impact of a known risk.
Risk Management Frameworks:

NIST RMF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework)
HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)
Common Threats and Risks:

Insider Threats: Malicious employees or vendors with authorized access.
External Risks: Threat actors attempting unauthorized access to information.
Internal Risks: Current/former employees, vendors, or partners posing a security risk.
Legacy Systems: Outdated systems with vulnerabilities.
Multiparty Risks: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors with access to sensitive information.
Software Compliance/Licensing: Unpatched or outdated software.
