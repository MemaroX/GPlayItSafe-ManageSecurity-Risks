Overall Security Posture

An organization's ability to defend critical assets and data.
Requires elements like security goals, risk management, compliance plans, and legal awareness.
Information Security (InfoSec) establishes processes to secure information using methods like:
Incident response
Vulnerability management
Application security
Cloud security
Infrastructure security
Asset Security

Focuses on managing the cybersecurity of organizational assets (physical & virtual data).
Includes storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
Requires tracking assets and data to minimize risk of exposure.
Security measures like impact analysis, recovery plans, and data exposure management are crucial.
Security Architecture and Engineering

Designs and implements tools, systems, and processes to protect data.
Emphasizes shared responsibility by all involved in security system design.
Key design principles include:
Threat modeling
Least privilege
Defense in depth
Fail securely
Separation of duties
Keep it simple
Zero trust
Trust but verify
Uses tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) for threat detection.
Communication and Network Security

Secures physical and wireless networks (on-site, remote, cloud).
Manages external connections for secure remote user access.
Network security controls (restricted access) protect user and network security.
Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Ensures user identities are trusted and access is authorized for physical and logical assets.
Prevents unauthorized access while allowing authorized users to perform tasks.
Uses the principle of least privilege (granting minimum access required).
Security Assessment and Testing

Identifies and mitigates risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in internal systems.
Uses penetration testing ("pen testing") to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
Involves security control testing, data collection/analysis, and security audits.
Cybersecurity professionals may audit user permissions to validate access levels.
Security Operations

Investigates potential data breaches and implements preventative measures after incidents.
Uses strategies like training, reporting, intrusion detection/prevention, SIEM tools, log management, incident management, playbooks, forensics, and post-breach reflection.
Cybersecurity professionals work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats.
Software Development Security

Uses secure programming practices to create secure applications.
Security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle (design, development, testing, release).
Application security testing helps identify and fix vulnerabilities.
Quality assurance and penetration testing ensure software meets security and performance standards.
